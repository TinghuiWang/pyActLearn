Multi-Class Performance Metrics
===============================

In most literature, standard multi-class performance metrics are used to evaluate an activity recognition algorithm.
In module ``pyActLearn.performace``, the following functions get the confusion matrix and calculate per-class
performance and overall micro and macro performance.

.. autofunction:: pyActLearn.performance.get_confusion_matrix

.. autofunction:: pyActLearn.performance.get_performance_array
